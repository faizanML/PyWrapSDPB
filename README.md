# PyWrapSDPB
Run SDPB (Semi-Definite Program Solver for Bootstrap) using a Python Notebook. SDPB can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/davidsd/sdpb).  

Import the package sdpb_pywrap.py to your Jupyter notebook. And provide the input Polynomial Matrix Problem for SDPB as dictated in the [SDPB manual] (https://github.com/davidsd/sdpb/blob/master/docs/SDPB_Manual/SDPB-Manual.pdf). Some simple examples are given in Tests.ipynb Jupyter Notebook. 

Docker Desktop needs to be installed (on a Mac or Windows PC) for SDPB to run.
